## The project in a nutshell:

In this repository you will find a full Bayesian analysis about Italy prices and yields situation of BTP during sovereign debt crisis of 2011.
The project has been developed for the second part of Statistical Methods for Data Science course with professor Luca Tardella, a fully Bayesian course.
The project is divided in sections, analyzing in the specific just the italain scenario:
- BTP-BUND (SPREAD) analysis with CHANGE POINT bayesian models, to understand in what measure Quantitative Easing policy impact the spread;
- Prices Returns VOLATILITY analysis witth GARCH moldes;
- Frequentist brief comparison and forecating.

## Comments about results
The aim of this work from a bayesian point of view is to highlight the fact that GARCH models are not suitable to model residuals that do not follow a standard normal distribuition.
In this repo you will find a t-Student alternative approach to avoid the problem.
Don't esitate to get in touch for clarifications and collaboration about it.
